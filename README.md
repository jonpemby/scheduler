# Scheduler

Work out a travel schedule in seconds.

Given an initial date, a max number of dates and companies to interview with Scheduler can help you figure out a flight schedule that works for you.

## Requirements

* Python 3.7.x
* Terminal or shell emulator - that's it!

## Example

```
python scheduler.py 2019-06-20 5 Brosoft "Silicon Valley Tech"
```


Outputs:
```
Brosoft
Leave: Thu Jun 20
Return: Fri Jun 21

Silicon Valley Tech
Leave: Mon Jun 24
Return: Tue Jun 25

Brosoft
Leave: Wed Jun 26
Return: Thu Jun 27

Silicon Valley Tech
Leave: Sun Jun 30
Return: Mon Jul 01

Brosoft
Leave: Tue Jul 02
Return: Wed Jul 03
```

## Why?

I had interviews I needed to schedule and I couldn't find anything that just interweaved a bunch of dates together with some company names and calculated departure times.
